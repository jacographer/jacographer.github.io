## Information for Survey Participants

**As of 8/1/20, new survey entries are no longer eligible to win prizes.**

You will not qualify for this survey if you are not a resident of Boone, Fayette, Jefferson, Kenton, or Warren County; if you are under 18 years of age or older than 34 years of age; if you do not own and use a smartphone.

The survey will be conducted online and should not take more than 10 minutes to complete. You will be asked to answer a series of questions regarding your smartphone usage habits and your understanding and practices of digital wellbeing. The questions will address smartphone use and digital wellbeing in the circumstances of a global pandemic, which may cause discomfort for respondents. Otherwise, there are no risks associated with the study.

Participation in the survey is entirely optional. You will not get any personal benefit from taking part in this study, though you will contribute to a better understanding of societal relationships between devices and users. There are no costs associated with taking part in this study.

When I write about or share the results from the study, I will write about the combined information. I will keep your name and other identifying information private.

I will make every effort to prevent anyone who is not on the research team from knowing that you gave us information, or what that information is. The survey responses will be collected via an embedded Google contact form. The form will use SSL transcription to transmit participant contact information to a Google spreadsheet where only I will have access to the data. After the survey is closed, the responses will be deleted from the Google spreadsheet and stored in an encrypted external hard drive that only I have access to and retained for 6 years, after which they will be permanently deleted.

I will make every effort to safeguard your data, but as with anything online, I cannot guarantee the security of data obtained via the Internet. Third-party applications used in this study may have Terms of Service and Privacy policies outside of the control of the University of Kentucky. 

You can choose to leave the study at any time. You will not be treated differently if you decide to stop taking part in the study. If you choose to leave the study early, data collected until that point will remain in the study database and may not be removed. 

You will be eligible to win $100 for taking part in this study. Two prize winners will be selected by random drawing from the pool of submitted emails. Each email will be counted as one entry; please do not submit to the study multiple times, as you will still only have one entry to win. The odds of winning the drawing will depend on the number of participants. Approximating 50-100 participants, the odds of winning one of the prize would be between 2%-4% for each participant. Participants will be eligible to win if they are qualified to complete the survey, and submitted their entries between 12:00am EST on 6/15/20 and 12:00am EST on 8/1/20. Participants who submit multiple entries will be disqualified from eligibility. 

I would also like to contact you with information about participating in future studies. If so, it will be limited to one additional related study. Your willingness to participate in this future study can be indicated in the survey. If you do not opt-in to be contacted for this future study, your information collected for this study will NOT be used or shared for future research studies, even if we remove the identifiable information such as your name and email address. 

If you have questions, suggestions, or concerns regarding this study or you want to withdraw from the study contact Jacob Saindon, MA student in the University of Kentucky, Department of Geography at jsaindon@uky.edu; I am a student being supervised in this research by Matthew W. Wilson, Associate Professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Kentucky (matthew.w.wilson@uky.edu)
