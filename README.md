## Social Distance and Digital Wellbeing

### Project Description
The aim of this research project is to learn about how Kentuckians are using their smartphones during the pandemic, and particularly how their smartphone use affects (and is affected by) their experiences of space while social distancing. The project consists of an online survey and in-depth interviews which ask participants about their smart phone usage habits, screen time metrics, and practices of digital wellbeing.

The survey is conducted online and should not take more than 10 minutes to complete. Eligible particpants will be entered to win one of two $100 cash prizes.
