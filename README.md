## Social Distance and Digital Wellbeing

### Project Description
The aim of this research project is to learn about how Kentuckians are using their smartphones during the pandemic, and particularly how their smartphone use affects (and is affected by) their experiences of space while social distancing. The project consists of an online survey and in-depth interviews which ask participants about their smartphone usage habits, screen time metrics, and practices of digital wellbeing. All participants must be smartphone owners between the ages of 18-34 residing in Boone, Fayette, Jefferson, Kenton or Warren Counties.

The survey is conducted online and should not take more than 10 minutes to complete. Eligible participants will be entered to win one of two $100 cash prizes.

Survey participants will be able to opt in to be contacted regarding an approximately 60-minute follow-up interview (done remotely). Participants will receive $20 for their time.
Email Jacob Saindon (jsaindon@uky.edu) if you have not completed the survey but would like to be considered for the interview.
