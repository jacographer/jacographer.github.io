## Social Distance and Digital Wellbeing

### Project Description
The aim of this research project was to learn about how Kentuckians are using their smartphones during the pandemic, and particularly how their smartphone use affected (and was affected by) their experiences of space while social distancing. The project consists of an online survey and in-depth interviews which ask participants about their smartphone usage habits, screen time metrics, and practices of digital wellbeing. All participants were smartphone owners between the ages of 18-34 residing in Boone, Fayette, Jefferson, Kenton or Warren Counties.
